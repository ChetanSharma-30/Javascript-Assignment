        >What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage
      state at the client's end, making state management easy for end-user while
      SessionState manages state at the server's end, making it easy to manage
      content from this end too. ViewState: It is maintained at only one level
      that is page-level.
